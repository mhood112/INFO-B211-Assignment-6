mhood112:  Use the built-in diabetes dataset from Scikit Learn and build 3 different machine learning regression models. Use the standard data division process described in the Machine Learning lecture to train and evaluate your models. performance.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's an example of how you can build three different machine learning regression models using the built-in diabetes dataset from Scikit Learn. The models will be Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. We'll follow the standard data division process to train and evaluate the models.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Load the diabetes dataset
diabetes = load_diabetes()
X = diabetes.data
y = diabetes.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the models
linear_reg = LinearRegression()
decision_tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=42)
random_forest = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)

# Train the models
linear_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
decision_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred_linear = linear_reg.predict(X_test)
y_pred_tree = decision_tree.predict(X_test)
y_pred_forest = random_forest.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the models
mse_linear = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_linear)
r2_linear = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_linear)

mse_tree = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_tree)
r2_tree = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_tree)

mse_forest = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_forest)
r2_forest = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_forest)

# Print the results
print("Linear Regression - MSE:", mse_linear, "R2:", r2_linear)
print("Decision Tree Regression - MSE:", mse_tree, "R2:", r2_tree)
print("Random Forest Regression - MSE:", mse_forest, "R2:", r2_forest)
```

This script will load the diabetes dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train three different regression models, make predictions, and evaluate the performance of each model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics.
